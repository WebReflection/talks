## Shadow DOM

<p>
The Shadow DOM API provides a mechanism to create content for an element that is virtually unreachable from outside the element.
</p>
<p>
The API provides also a way to place content already available as <code>&lt;slot&gt;</code>, inside the shadowed DOM tree, also known as <code>shadowRoot</code> property.
