## hyperHTML

<p>
The <a href="https://viperhtml.js.org/hyperhtml/documentation/">hyperHTML</a> library is a 5K virtual DOM alternative that updates only parts of a DOM tree represented by template literal interpolations.
</p>

```js
hyperHTML(el)`
<p attr=${'updated as attribute'}>
  Updated as ${'single text content'}
  ${['a', 'b', 'c'].map(
    txt => hyperHTML`<span>span for: ${txt}</span>`
  )
</p>`;
```
