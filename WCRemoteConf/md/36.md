## V1 Has No Native Extends

There is [a thread](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/509) with about 188 comments
I might not go through right now but I'll try to summarize.

Native extends are part of the [specifications](https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/scripting.html#custom-elements-customized-builtin-example) and
a person called Yurak [has been working on it](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=652579#c3).
