<div class="fragment fade-in">
In 2014, during a Twitter Hackathon, I wanted to demonstrate
it was possible to create something like:
</div>

```html
<tweet-slug>@WebReflection</tweet-slug>
```

<div class="fragment fade-in">
capable of showing up basic credentials, avatar, and info
about any handler.
</div>
