### Browser Compatibility !

The only polyfill at that time was from [Polymer](https://github.com/oliver-moran/custom-elements/blob/master/src/CustomElements.js#L29),
and it was incompatible with all Mobile browsers I was targeting. How to solve?

<div class="fragment fade-in">I created [an alternative](https://github.com/WebReflection/document-register-element) that worked everywhere.</div>
