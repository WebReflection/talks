## V1 expectations VS reality

Custom Elements have an upgrade mechanism that
<em>might</em> have problems.

You can always add listeners or attach shadow DOM,
but you cannot always add children or inject content.

It depends if the element is parsed and upgraded before
the page body is fully parsed or after.

In <strong>V0</strong> API this issue was mitigated via `createdCallback`
</div>
