## V1 Augmented Shenanigans

I have [deeply explained](https://medium.com/@WebReflection/a-case-for-js-classes-without-classes-9e60b3b5992#.loseouw99) all issues
related to Babel class transformation, and there is a long-time standing [bug](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/4480)
about `extends` in general which is plain broken in Babel, specially when it comes to natives.
