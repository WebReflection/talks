### Everybody knows Template literals, right?

<div class="fragment fade-in">
There are many things can go wrong so tempalte literals
are not a good substitute for mustache.
</div>

```js
document.body.innerHTML = `
  Description: ${unsafe}
  <img
    onclick="${unsafe}"
    alt="${unsafe}"
  >
`;
```

<div class="fragment fade-in">
Template literals are still plain strings.<br>
These have no meaning whatsoever.
</div>
